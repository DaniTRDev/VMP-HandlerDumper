# VMP-HandlerDumper
This is a script that with a few changes will dump each VM handler and its associated VM opcode. It has been tested in VMP 3.5.1.

I've included 2 signatures that can be used to locate VM dispatchers. Although this can be done by following the VM enter of a virtualized function.

# DISCLAIMER
I've released this script for people that are interested into learning how do the new-gen packers work it's not intented to use in cracking or any other action that breaks the CC of the application that you are using this on. I'm not responsible of anything you can do with this.
