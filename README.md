# VMP-HandlerDumper
This is a script that with a few changes will dump each VM handler and its associated VM opcode. It has been tested in VMP 3.5.1.

I've included 2 signatures that can be used to locate VM dispatchers. Although this can be done by following the VM enter of a virtualized function.
